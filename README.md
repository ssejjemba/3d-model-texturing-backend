# 3D Model Texturing Backend

## Project Overview

This repository contains the backend services for the 3D Model Texturing application, a system designed to authenticate users, handle the upload of 3D models and texture images, and utilize AI to smartly apply textures to 3D models. The project leverages a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and robustness.

## Microservices

The backend is composed of the following microservices:

- `user-authentication`: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- `file-upload-management`: Handles the uploading and storage of 3D models and texture images.
- `ai-processing`: Processes the 3D models using AI for texture painting.
- `3d-model-preparation`: Prepares and optimizes 3D models for processing.
- `rendering-visualization`: Renders the final textured 3D models.
- `database-service`: Manages data persistence.
- `api-gateway`: Serves as the entry point for frontend requests.
- `monitoring-logging`: Monitors services and logs activities.
- `security-compliance`: Ensures the security and compliance of the system.
- `backup-recovery`: Manages data backup and recovery strategies.
- `admin-support`: Provides administrative and support functionalities.

Each microservice is contained in its own subdirectory within this repository.
